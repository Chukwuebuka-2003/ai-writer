## Utilizing the possibility of Open AI ChatGPT3 engines

The python code creates a tool that can write a blog post using Artificial Intelligence. It uses a powerful language model called GPT-3 made by OpenAI to generate a blog post for the user.

The user starts by typing in the title of their blog post and the content they want to include in it. They can also add extra prompts or ideas to help guide the language model to write their blog post.

The user can then choose which version of GPT-3 they want to use from a dropdown menu. Each version of GPT-3 has different strengths and weaknesses. Some are better at creative writing, while others are better at writing factual content.

Once the user has provided all the necessary inputs, they can click on a button to generate their blog post. The tool sends all the inputs to the GPT-3 language model, which then uses them to write a new blog post.

The generated blog post is displayed on the screen, and the user can copy and paste it into their own blog or website. The tool can be run by typing a command into the computer's terminal.

Overall, this tool is a simple way for anyone to generate high-quality written content for their blog or website using the power of Artificial Intelligence.
